        maybe_create_another_voucher()


class Inquiry(Voucher):
    some = models.TextField()
    information = models.TextField()
    we = models.TextField()
    need = models.TextField()

    # Mostly, after a voucher approved, some new records will be created and connected by the inlines.
    def post_approval(self):
        for obj in self.inlines:
            Quotation.objects.create(source_obj=obj)


# If a Voucher have inlines, define an inline model like this:

    parent_voucher = Inquiry

    details = models.TextField()
